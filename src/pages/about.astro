            Hey, I&apos;m <b>Angel Lopez</b>. I live in Toronto, Canada, but
            originally I&apos;m from North Macedonia. As a fullstack engineer, I
            enjoy building interesting pet projects from scratch. Of course,
            just like any developer, I end up abandoning them. I&apos;m a super
            curious fellow and I&apos;m always up to learn something new. Aside
            from learning new things, I enjoy live streaming on Twitch and
            creating courses for egghead.io.
